## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# OpenAI Configuration (Required for AI features)
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here

# Firebase Configuration (if using Firebase)
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-firebase-api-key-here
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-firebase-auth-domain
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-firebase-project-id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-firebase-storage-bucket
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-firebase-messaging-sender-id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-firebase-app-id
```

### 2. OpenAI API Key Setup

1. Visit [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Create a new API key
3. Add it to your `.env` file as `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY`
4. Ensure you have credits in your OpenAI account

### 3. Fallback Behavior

If OpenAI API is not configured or fails:
- System automatically falls back to rule-based analysis
- Uses compromise.js for NLP processing
- Provides basic grammar and style suggestions
- All UI features remain functional

## Technical Architecture

### AI Service Layer
- **Primary**: OpenAI GPT-4o integration
- **Fallback**: Rule-based analysis using compromise.js and typo-js
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with user feedback
- **Performance**: Debounced analysis to prevent excessive API calls

### UI Components
- **HighlightedTextArea**: Real-time text highlighting with suggestion overlays
- **SuggestionTooltip**: Educational tooltip with detailed explanations and actions
- **ToneAnalysisPanel**: Comprehensive tone analysis modal
- **WritingEditor**: Main editor with integrated AI controls

### Data Models
- **TextSuggestion**: Standardized suggestion format with educational content
- **ToneAnalysis**: Comprehensive tone metrics and recommendations
- **GrammarAnalysisResult**: AI analysis results with confidence scoring

## User Experience Flow

1. **Student starts writing** → Auto-analysis begins (1-second delay)
2. **Issues detected** → Text highlighted with colored underlines
3. **Student clicks suggestion** → Educational tooltip appears
4. **Student reads explanation** → Learns why the change improves their writing
5. **Student applies fix** → Text updated, suggestion dismissed
6. **Manual analysis available** → "AI Analysis" button for immediate feedback
7. **Tone analysis on demand** → Comprehensive emotional impact assessment

## Performance Considerations

- **Debounced Analysis**: 1-second delay prevents excessive API calls
- **Fallback System**: Ensures functionality without OpenAI dependency
- **Client-side Processing**: Basic analysis continues during API calls
- **Error Recovery**: Clear error messages with retry options

## Success Metrics

- **Grammar Accuracy**: AI provides contextually appropriate corrections
- **Educational Value**: Students learn from explanations, not just fix errors
- **User Experience**: Seamless integration without interrupting writing flow
- **Performance**: Sub-2 second response times for most analyses

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Feature Integration**: Finish vocabulary and conciseness features
2. **Goal Personalization**: Implement leadership/resilience theme detection
3. **User Feedback Loop**: Add suggestion rating system for continuous improvement
4. **Performance Optimization**: Implement caching for repeated text analysis
5. **Advanced Features**: Add writing style consistency checking
6. **User Analytics**: Track suggestion acceptance rates and learning progress

## Development Notes
